<h2>I am an educator, designer, and researcher.</h2>
<br>
I care a lot about designing for equity and designing for learner empowerment. In the fall, I was a computer science teacher and researcher in Hong Kong for the Transformative Learning Technologies Lab.
In January, I was on my way to Beijing to start a Fulbright, but now
I'm sheltering in place, TAing CS377U (Understanding Users) and taking classes as a CS Master's student at Stanford. Take care.
