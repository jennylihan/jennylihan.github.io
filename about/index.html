<h2>I am an educator, designer, and researcher.</h2>
<br>
I'm currently pursuing my Master's in Computer Science, as part of the <a href="https://hci.stanford.edu/" target="_blank"> Stanford HCI research group</a>. I care a lot about designing for equity and designing for learner empowerment. During my gap year, I was a computer science teacher and researcher in Hong Kong for the <a href="https://tltlab.org/" target="_blank"> Transformative Learning Technologies Lab</a>, 
  designing and investigating a constructionist, student-driven, project-based curriculum. Most recently this year, I was the TA for <a href="https://hci.stanford.edu/courses/cs377u/" target="_blank">CS377U (Understanding Users)</a> and the course designer of the inaugural <a href="https://la-tech.org/snap-academies" target="_blank">Snap Engineering Academy</a>.
