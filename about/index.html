      <h3>i study ed, tech, & edtech.</h3>
      I'm pursuing my Master's in Computer Science as part of the <a href="https://hci.stanford.edu/" target="_blank"> Stanford HCI research group</a>. During my gap year, I was a computer science teacher and researcher in Hong Kong for the <a href="https://tltlab.org/" target="_blank"> Transformative Learning Technologies Lab</a>. More recently, I was a member of the teaching team that revamped <a href="https://symsys.stanford.edu" target="_blank">SYMSYS 1 (Minds and Machines)</a>, and the first hire at design studio <a href="https://nextshiftlearning.com/" target="_blank"> Next Shift Learning</a>.
      <br><br>
      I care deeply about designing for equity and learner empowerment,
      especially when it comes to computer science education, connected learning, edtech, and social computing. My experiences center around user research, app development, and curriculum design.
