        <p>I'm equal parts ed + tech.</p>
        <p>Currently, I'm a Master's student at Stanford studying Human-Computer Interaction with a focus on learning technologies. My experiences center around curriculum design, web/app dev, and UX research.</p>
        <p>I'm working on ways to make computer science education more equitable and personally meaningful for <b>everyone</b>. I think everyone should feel empowered to tinker with technology (some of my inspiration: <a href="http://beyondbitsandatoms.org/pages/course-info.html" target="_blank">‚öõÔ∏è</a> <a href="https://faculty.washington.edu/ajko/slides/Penn2020CriticalComputingEducation.pdf" target="_blank">ü¶Ñ</a> <a href="https://glitch.com/" target="_blank">üéè</a> <a href="https://1derful.org/phdthesis.php" target="_blank">üîç</a> <a href="https://dynamicland.org/" target="_blank">üó∫</a> <a href="https://e.gg/about" target="_blank">üç≥</a> <a href="https://ncase.me/" target="_blank">üëæ</a> <a href="https://mayaontheinter.net/"  target="_blank">üå∏</a> <a href="https://www.gethopscotch.com/"  target="_blank">üß±</a>).</p>

        <p>Recently, I've been a high school CS teacher for the
        <a href="https://cs.fablearn.org/" target="_blank"> Fablearn group at Columbia Teacher's College</a>, a lead instructional designer at <a href="https://nextshiftlearning.com/" target="_blank">Next Shift Learning</a>, and a member of the <a href="https://twitter.com/stanfordsymsys1" target="_blank">SYMSYS1 teaching team</a>.</p>

    <h3>my education: </h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Growing up, I loved school; I once got sent home sick in kindergarten and cried about missing out. My teachers were my greatest role models growing up in Bay Area public schools, and I feel strongly about contributing to public education in the future.</li>
      <li>As an undergrad at Stanford, I studied <a href="https://symsys.stanford.edu" target="_blank">Symbolic Systems</a>, a major combining, philosophy, psychology and computer science. I chased the question of how people learn.</li>
      <li>For 3 months, I studied abroad in Santiago, Chile, and learned all about linguistic relativity and Gepe.</li>
      <li>In 2019, I was awarded a <a href="https://us.fulbrightonline.org/" target="_blank">Fulbright Research Scholarship</a> to study at Peking University in China. The U.S.-China Fulbright program was indefinitely suspended in July of 2020.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>things I'm proud of: </h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Supporting the scholars from <a href="https://la-tech.org/snap-academies-class-of-2020" target="_blank">the Snap Engineering Academy summer program which I codesigned in 2020</a> as they land internships at Snap, Nextdoor, IDEO, and beyond for the summer of 2021.</li>
      <li>Being community manager at <a href="http://instagram.com/instahammarskjold" target="_blank">Hammarskj√∂ld</a>, a 33-person housing cooperative from 2018 - 2019.</li>
      <li>Codirecting <a href="https://www.instagram.com/stanfordalternativebreaks/">Alternative Spring Break</a> from 2019-2020, one of the largest public service and peer-learning programs at Stanford.</li>
      <li>Teaching ninth graders at Breakthrough Silicon Valley and leading <a href="https://fast.stanford.edu/" target="_blank">college access workshops</a> in San Jose.</li>
      <li>Practicing English with janitors on the night shift at Stanford as part of the student group <a href="https://habla.stanford.edu" target="_blank">Habla.</a></li>
      <li>Highlighting community-driven public spaces in Santiago & Hong Kong with the <a href="https://humancities.org" target="_blank"> Human Cities Initiative</a>.</li>
      <!-- <li>Working with a team of new editors to curate, edit, and publish select undergraduate writing on education, in <a href="https://ojs.stanford.edu/ojs/index.php/ce/issue/view/69">The Cutting Edge.</a></li> -->
