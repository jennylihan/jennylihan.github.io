<h3 id="2-august">2 August</h3>
<p>I’m in Hong Kong!
This summer, I had a really neat opportunity to engage with STEM education philanthropy. I learned that philanthropy is not only often disorganized and far removed from the communities it benefits, but it can be <a href="https://press.princeton.edu/titles/14186.html" target="\_blank">a threat to democracy</a>. I also learned that more than anything, we need educators in and out of school who care about their students and are excited/capable to teach science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.</p>

<h3 id="3-august">3 August</h3>

<p>I learned that Cyberport was built by Li Ka Shing’s son and it was meant to be the tech valley of Hong Kong. It didn’t quite turn out that way…</p>

<!-- ### 4 August -->

<!-- Nicole asked me, "Why do you like Hong Kong?" I learned I need to reflect more often because I didn't know what to say for a solid ten seconds.  -->

<h3 id="5-august">5 August</h3>

<p>Jacob shared <a href="http://learning.hccs.edu/faculty/emily.klotz/engl1302-3/readings/the-ones-who-walk-away-from-omelas-ursula-le-guin/view" target="\_blank">this</a> with me. One of the most harrowing pieces I’ve read because it is so close to home. But my fear is that those who walk away, if aimless, are just as misguided as those who stay within the city gates.</p>

<h3 id="6-august">6 August</h3>

<p>I learned that there are <a href="https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/society/article/2187375/why-more-young-people-are-opting-co-living-spaces-hong-kong" target="\_blank">co-ops in Hong Kong</a> …but they’re a lot more corporate. Interesting move towards communal living, which makes sense given extreme housing market. But I wonder how intentional and tightknit these communities are.</p>

<h3 id="7-august">7 August</h3>

<p>I learned that there are snakes in Hong Kong.
Also, Jacob told me today that Asana was genuinely created under the banner of <a href="https://asana.com/company" target="\_blank">Social Good™</a> by its founder.</p>

<h3 id="8-august">8 August</h3>

<p>I learned that Telegraph Bay, where I work, was the site of the first telegraph cables in Hong Kong. Today I also thought about the Chinese moral education system, which focused on interpersonal qualities and urges “先做人， 后做事”： focus on your personhood, then your work. It reminded me of The Farewell, which pitted the differences between East and West in such familiar vocabulary for me. Growing up, had I received a Western education, with Eastern tendencies?</p>

<h3 id="18-august">18 August</h3>

<p>I learned that Mahjong schools don’t teach mahjong.</p>

<h3 id="22-august">22 August</h3>

<p>I learned that <code class="highlighter-rouge">glocalization</code> is a real word, and it is the process of assimilating one’s business strategy to the local context when overseas. As Jacob calls it, it is “culturally responsive colonialism.”</p>

<h3 id="23-august">23 August</h3>

<p>I learned about the term <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whataboutism" target="\_blank">whataboutism, or changing the subject</a>. Someone on Slack mentioned that we must carefully evaluate the use of whataboutism in social media rhetoric against Hong Kong.</p>

<p>I also learned that, according to my VIA survey, my most salient strengths are: humility, curiosity, forgiveness, love of learning, and teamwork. Qualities I would like to work on are: perseverance, reliability, perspective, and prudence.</p>
