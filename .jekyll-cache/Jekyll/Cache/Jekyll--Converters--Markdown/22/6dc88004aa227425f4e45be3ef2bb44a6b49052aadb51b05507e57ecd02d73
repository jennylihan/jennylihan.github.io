I"A<p>One day Cindy and I were at the Mountain View Caltrain station and we realized that if we wanted to visit Seattle, we could just buy a ticket and go. This was e a r t h - s h a t t e r i n g. At the time, we were only a year out of high school and most of our solo travels were still limited to the range of the Caltrain. So our trip to Seattle was the first trip of our “adult lives” in the sense that we thought up, planned, and budgeted the trip entirely on our own. Even though we looked like lost kids and couldn’t get into the bars yet, it was exhilirating.</p>
