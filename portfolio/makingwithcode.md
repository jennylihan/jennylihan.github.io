<h2>How do we reorient computer science education to be about making with code?</h2>

<h3>üí≠üí≠ About the project:</h3>
I joined Jacob Wolf, Krates Ng, and Jonathan Pang as a research assistant for the project spearheaded by Chris Proctor as part of the <a href="https://fablearn.org/research/" target="\_blank">Transformative Learning Technologies Lab</a>.

Our project was to develop and teach an introductory computer science class at the Independent Schools Foundation Academy in Hong Kong. Our class looked very different from a normal high school class.

Why was it so different? Because it was rooted in *constructionism*, a learning theory that stresses learning through making. We hoped students would adopt code as a tool with which to think and create, instead of as a subject that needed to be memorized and regurgitated. So:

* We didn't hand out tests (we assigned self-directed projects)
* We didn't focus on syntax (we focused on computational practices and concepts)
* We didn't use any kid-friendly code editors (we taught our beginners with authentic tools such as Github, Jupyter Notebook, and Python via Terminal and Atom)
* We didn't pretend to be the experts in the room (we invited our students to codesign and at times coteach the class)

These were the first unit projects that our students created in Python (the prompt was "draw something personally meaningful with code"):

We also worked as learning technology consultants alongside non-Computer Science teachers to integrate technology into their curriculum. For example, we experimented with <a href="http://unfold.studio/" target="\_blank">digital storytelling</a> in 7th Grade Classics and Augmented Reality in 6th Grade Drama.

In doing so, we also outlined a broader computational vision at the school:
