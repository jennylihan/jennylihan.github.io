<h2>How do we reorient c.s. education to be about making with code?</h2>

(We asked our students to draw something personally meaningful, using the Python turtle library.)

<h3>üí≠üí≠ About the project:</h3>
I joined Jacob Wolf, Krates Ng, and Jonathan Pang as a research assistant for the project spearheaded by Chris Proctor as part of the <a href="https://fablearn.org/research/" target="\_blank">Transformative Learning Technologies Lab</a>.

Our project was to develop and teach an introductory computer science class at the Independent Schools Foundation Academy in Hong Kong. Our class looked very different from a normal high school class.

Why was it so different? Because it was rooted in *constructionism*, a learning theory that stresses learning through making. We hoped students would adopt code as a tool with which to think and create, instead of as a subject that needed to be memorized and regurgitated. So:

* We didn't hand out tests (we assigned self-directed projects)
* We didn't focus on syntax (we focused on computational practices and concepts)
* We didn't use any kid-friendly code editors (we taught our beginners with authentic tools such as Github, Jupyter Notebook, and Python via Terminal and Atom)
* We didn't pretend to be the experts in the room (we invited our students to codesign and at times coteach the class)

We also worked as learning technology consultants alongside non-Computer Science teachers to integrate technology into their curriculum. For example, we experimented with <a href="http://unfold.studio/" target="\_blank">digital storytelling</a> in 7th Grade Classics and Augmented Reality in 6th Grade Drama.

In doing so, we also outlined a broader computational vision at the school:
