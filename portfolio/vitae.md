<h2>What can we learn about the future of digital labor from hiring halls?</h2>

There's a concept in economics (a Nobel-prize-winning concept) called the Market for Lemons. It's a problem related to the unclear signaling of quality (in "lemon" cars, for example) that leads to overall distrust and lower quality output in a system. Historically, communities of workers (most notably in the longshoremen industry) have bypassed this problem by forming hiring halls and unions to vouch for each other and ensure high standards. Gig work is on the rise again. How can online platforms promote complex and high-quality gig work?

I joined PhD student Ali Alkhatib and Prof. Michael Bernstein (alongside Gobi Dasu, Alison Chi, and Emily Hu) to investigate what a sociotechnical reputation system could look like for Amazon Mechanical Turk workers. Drawing from previous participatory design work with Turkers and organizational behavior research, we created a Google Chrome extension and conducted quantitative research with 100+ Turkers.

<h3>💭💭 We were inspired by:</h3>
* <a href="https://hci.stanford.edu/publications/2015/dynamo/DynamoCHI2015.pdf" target="\_blank"> dynamo</a>, a collective action platform for MTurk workers
* Governing the Commons by Elinor Ostrom

<h3>🛠️🛠️ We used tools such as:</h3>
* HTML, JS, CSS
* Node.js, PostgreSQL
* Qualtrics
