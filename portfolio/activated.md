<h2>How might we provide guidance to high school students without a counselor during the college app process?</h2>

Here's the design rationale:
In the U.S., the recommended student-to-counselor ratio is <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2016/09/the-neglected-link-in-the-high-school-to-college-pipeline/500213/" target="\_blank">250:1</a>.

In upper-middle-class South Bay neighborhoods, that ratio becomes 1:1 as parents secure private consultation packages for their college-bound children.

Drawing from the experiences of high school students from the bay area and from our own experiences in public schools, my team of four designed <b>activated</b>, a motivational college prep app that acts as a roadmap by organizing academic goals in a fun and intuitive way.

<h3>🛠️🛠️ We used tools such as :</h3>

* Design Thinking & Human-Centered Design principles (for frameworks)
* Sketch & Marvel (for prototyping)
* React Native (for app development)
