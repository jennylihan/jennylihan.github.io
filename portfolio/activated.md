<h3>üí≠ Design Rationale</h3>

In the U.S., the recommended student-to-counselor ratio is 250:1.

In upper-middle-class South Bay neighborhoods, that ratio becomes 1:1 as parents secure private consultation packages for their college-bound children.

In Oakland public schools (and undderresourced schools throughout the nation), that ratio is more like 600:1.

Drawing from the experiences of high school students from the bay area and from our own experiences in public schools, my team of four designed activated, a motivational college prep app that acts as a roadmap by organizing academic goals in a fun and intuitive way.

<h3>üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used</h3>

* Design Thinking & Human-Centered Design principles (for frameworks)
* Sketch & Marvel (for prototyping)
* React Native (for app development)
