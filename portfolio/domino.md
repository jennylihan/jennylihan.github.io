<h2>How might we design for tinkering and computational thinking with only mobile phones?</h2>

Here's the design rationale:

The digital divide is no longer just about access; we see a surge in mobile phone use around the world.
But more sinister and concerning is the growing <a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/trtr.1603" target="\_blank">digital use divide</a>, wherein some children are afforded the education and confidence to be remixers and creators of technology
while other children are relegated to be consumers. It's about digital literacy, and we hope in a world where all children to develop it.

So Kylie, Aashna, and I sought to leverage mobile phone technologies to provide the same learning experiences that affluent children were receiving via microcontrollers such as Arduinos in makerspaces or computer science classes. 

Here's the thing: our phones, simplified, are microcontrollers with all sorts of input sensors and output actuators.So we decided to create an app that allowed children to program and connect different sensors and actuators on their phones.

<h3>💭💭 We were inspired by </h3>
* Constructionism (as a learning theory)
* <a href="https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/95590" target="\_blank">Jay Silver's dissertation:</a> the idea of turning the world into your construction kit (He's the guy behind Makey Makeys)
* Our teammate Aashna's experiences teaching computer science to middle school girls in Hyderabad, India
* <a href="https://ifttt.com/" target="\_blank">IFTTT</a>, a Internet-of-Things app, mostly used for productivity, not education
* <a href="https://sciencejournal.withgoogle.com/" target="\_blank">Google Science Journal app</a>

<h3>🛠️🛠️ We used tools such as:</h3>

* Learner-centered design (as frameworks)
* Marvel (for prototyping)
* Android Studio (for app development)

<h3>✨✨ Oh, and we made it to Norway to present at the Interaction Design & Children conference in 2018! This project also went on to become Aashna's master's project.</h3>
