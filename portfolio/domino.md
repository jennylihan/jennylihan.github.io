<h3>‚ú® Setting and Collaborators</h3>
This was a project for EDUC236: Beyond Bits and Atoms in the Winter of 2018 taught by Prof. Paulo Blikstein, Prof. Chris Proctor, Dr. Richard Davis, and Veronica Lin. I worked with Aashna Shroff (who further developed this idea into her <a href="https://ed.stanford.edu/ldt/students/ma-projects/domino" target="_blank"> master's project</a>) and Kylie Jue. This class changed my life, and I was honored to have the opportunity to TA it the following year.

*We made it all the way to Norway to present at the Interaction Design & Children conference in 2018 where I accidentally had a coffee chat with THE pioneering computer science education researcher Mark Guzdial and sat next to science journalist Aatish Bhatia during the demo fair. Whew, what a time.

<h3>üí≠ Design Rationale</h3>
The digital divide is no longer just about access.

We see a surge in mobile phone use around the world. But more sinister and concerning is the growing <a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/trtr.1603" target="\_blank">digital use divide</a>, wherein some children are afforded the education and confidence to be remixers and creators of technology
while other children are relegated to be consumers. It's about digital literacy, and we hope for a world in which all children can develop those skills and perspectives.

So Kylie, Aashna, and I sought to leverage mobile phone technologies to provide the same learning experiences that affluent children were receiving via microcontrollers such as Arduinos in makerspaces or computer science classes.

**Arduinos are neat. But they're expensive and out-of-reach for many kids.**

Here's the thing: our phones, simplified, are microcontrollers with all sorts of input sensors and output actuators.So we decided to create an app that allowed children to program and connect different sensors and actuators on their phones.

<h3>ü§î Inspiration</h3>
* Constructionism (as a learning theory)
* <a href="https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/95590" target="\_blank">Jay Silver's dissertation:</a> the idea of turning the world into your construction kit (He's the guy behind Makey Makeys)
* Our teammate Aashna's experiences teaching computer science to middle school girls in Hyderabad, India
* <a href="https://ifttt.com/" target="\_blank">IFTTT</a>, a Internet-of-Things app, mostly used for productivity, not education
* <a href="https://sciencejournal.withgoogle.com/" target="\_blank">Google Science Journal app</a>

<h3>üõ†Ô∏è Takeaways for my personal toolkit </h3>
* <a href="http://papers.cumincad.org/data/works/att/952f.content.pdf" target="_blank">Learner-centered design</a> really is different from user-centered design.
* Connect theory to practice; in this case, we were intentional about <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/1161135.1161153" target="_blank">glass-boxing</a> the inner workings of our phones, using dominoes as a mental model / object-to-think-with.
* Designing a UI interface requires an organized <a href="https://www.invisionapp.com/inside-design/guide-to-design-systems/" target="_blank">design system</a>...we did this on Google Slides and Marvel but in theory you should have it somewhere neat and presentable like Figma.
* Debugging an Android app at 2 am is not fun but having the CERAS building all to ourselves to blast Saba and Chance the Rapper is pretty thrilling.
