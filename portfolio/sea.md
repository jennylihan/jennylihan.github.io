<h3>âœ¨ Setting and Collaborators</h3>
In 2018, Snap, Inc. and LA-Tech.org launched the <a href="https://la-tech.org/snap-academies" target="\_blank">Snap Academies</a> to host a select group of community college students in Los Angeles for a summer of creative/technical workshops and professional development.

In 2020, I was tapped by <a href="https://nextshiftlearning.com/" target="\_blank">Sergio Rosas</a> to become the lead instructional designer of Snap Engineering Academy in its inaugural year.

I spearheaded the unit plan, weekly projects, program schedule, student materials, and evaluation for the six-week program focused on web development. 

Michael Christenson, DeMarkus Matthews, Dandy Reyes, and I developed code and led workshops throughout the summer. 

<h3>ðŸ™Œ Results</h3>
Alumni from Snap Engineering Academy 2020 landed internships at Snap, Inc., Nextdoor, Code2040, and IDEO.

We're currently cooking up Snap Engineering Academy 2.0 for 2021!
