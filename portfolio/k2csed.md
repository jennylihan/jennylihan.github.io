<h2>How might we design tools for storytelling and computational thinking for pre-literate learners?</h2>

I joined as a research assistant for PhD candidate Griffin Dietz, and over 2 quarters, we conducted preliminary design work for a voice-user interface to assist children as
they created and edited their own audio stories. We also conducted user testing with 6 - 8 year-old users in Palo Alto.

<h3>🛠️🛠️ We used tools such as:</h3>

* Needfinding: qualitative interviews with K-2 students and CS educators, observations, and qualitative coding
* Design Thinking, Wizard of Oz prototyping
* Google Voice User Interfaces

<h3>✏️✏️ Design Guidelines for Early Childhood Computer Science Education Tools</h3>
 is a book chapter for  Hasso Plattner with Griffin Dietz, Prof. Hyo Gweon, Prof. James Landay, forthcoming!
