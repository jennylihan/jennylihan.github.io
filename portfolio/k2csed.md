<h2>HCI Research: How might we design tools for storytelling and computational thinking for pre-literate learners?</h2>

<h3>‚ú® Setting and Collaborators</h3>
I worked as a research assistant for Griffin Dietz (CS PhD candidate) who was advised by Prof. James Landay and Prof. Hyo Gweon, alongside Jimmy Le and Nadin Tamer. I mostly contributed to the early needfinding and pilot testing as well as the learning evaluation towards the end.

<h3>‚úèÔ∏è Publication</h3>
"Design Guidelines for Early Childhood Computer Science Education Tools" is a book chapter for  Hasso Plattner with Griffin Dietz, Prof. Hyo Gweon, Prof. James Landay, forthcoming!

A paper summarizing our research was accepted to **CHI '21**! Stay tuned for pdf.

<h3>üí≠ Design Rationale </h3>

I joined at the inception of the project, and over 2 quarters, we conducted generative research and prototyping for a voice-user interface to assist children as they created and edited their own audio stories. We also conducted user testing with 6 - 8-year-old users in Palo Alto. From this work, we developed the design rationale, summarized in these slides:

<h3>üõ†Ô∏è Takeaways for my personal toolkit </h3>
* This was my first experience going through a design-based research project cycle from start to finish; I feel that I particularly leveled up in mixed-methods research and experiment design.
* Voice User Interfaces are powerful, but they require too much cognitive load, especially for young children. A combination with visual cues is the way to go.
* I dove deep into the literature of evaluating learning transfer. Fun fact: I created the Scratch animations for the learning transfer task, and the avatars are voiced by my brother and me!
