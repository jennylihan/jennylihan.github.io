<h3>✨✨ A presentation I created to summarize my research assistantship:</h3>

<h3>✏️✏️ Design Guidelines for Early Childhood Computer Science Education Tools</h3>
 is a book chapter for  Hasso Plattner with Griffin Dietz, Prof. Hyo Gweon, Prof. James Landay, forthcoming!

<h3>💭💭 About the project: </h3>

I joined as a research assistant for PhD candidate Griffin Dietz, and over 2 quarters, we conducted generative research and prototyping for a voice-user interface to assist children as
they created and edited their own audio stories. We also conducted user testing with 6 - 8-year-old users in Palo Alto.

<h3>🛠️🛠️ We used tools such as:</h3>

* Qualitative interviews with K-2 students and CS educators, observations, and qualitative coding
* Design Thinking, Wizard of Oz prototyping
* Google Voice User Interface
