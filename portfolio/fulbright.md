For the 2019-2020 school year, I was awarded a Fulbright Research Scholarship to conduct ten months of original research and study in China.

<h3>🛠️🛠️ We used tools such as :</h3>

* Design Thinking & Human-Centered Design principles (for frameworks)
* Sketch & Marvel (for prototyping)
* React Native (for app development)

<h3>✏️✏️ You can find our process and documentation <a href="https://hci.stanford.edu/courses/cs147/2017/au/projects/equalizingsociety/activated/" target="\_blank"> here.</a></h3>

<h3>✨✨ Oh, and our poster won Best Poster at the CS147 expo!</h3>
