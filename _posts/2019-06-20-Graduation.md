What did I learn? Here's a running list.

* epistemic injustice (miranda fricker)
* statistics (is fake)
* the whorffian hypothesis: your world view depends on your language (to some extent)
* service can be harmful if done wrong. why servitude can be bad.
* toxic relationships
* mental health is cultural
* qualitative research answers questions quantitative research cannot touch.
* validity may be unattainable
* fitt's law and the apple dock
* constructionism is a learning theory. we don't have much more besides theories.
