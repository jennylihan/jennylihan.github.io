	<h1>Coming Home: High School Workshops</h1>

	<div>
		<p>My friend and fellow Stanford student Cindy Nguyen are proud alumni of public schools in the bay area.</p>
    <p>Freshman year, we felt the urge to take some of the immmense resources we found at Stanford and bring them back to our communities.<br>
    <p>With funding from the Haas Center for Public Service, we started an initiative, <a target=blank href="https://www.facebook.com/stanfordcatalist">Stanford Catalist</a>, devoted to promoting college access at Independence High, Cindy's alma mater.
		Some activities we hosted included: a free mock SAT practice test, guest speakers from different majors, college application advice, free trips to Stanford (organized by Stanford Splash). </p>
		<p>Most recently, we've been mentoring students at Andrew Hill High School through <a target=blank href="https://news.stanford.edu/2016/12/30/stanford-program-brings-science-mentors-san-jose-high-school/">Stanford FAST</a>, a science
		mentorship program created by Stanford grad students. Just for fun, check out this workshop on presenting at science fairs that I put together:</p>
