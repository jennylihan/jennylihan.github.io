	<h1>Santiago, Chile: Study Abroad</h1>

	<div>
		<p>Spring quarter of my sophomore year (2017), I studied abroad in Santiago, Chile, through the Stanford Bing Overseas Studies Program. You can find a summary of my experiences on my blog (currently under construction). Here's a quick summary: </p>

		<p>
		My 82 days in Chile were filled with breath-taking views, amazing people, mayonnaise, and many 'firsts' (biked through the desert! went on a road trip! saw a glacier! took the metro and wandered around a city! mastered the subjunctive- m√°s o menos!). I think the best way to summarize the culture shock and sharedness I experienced would be with the arrollados primavera sold on the street corners: a spring roll like usual on the outside but filled with jamon and queso on the inside. That is also a pretty good description of myself after newfound aspects of my identity. Really grateful for the opportunity to have studied abroad and scratched the surface in subjects ranging from the Whorfian hypothesis to socio-spatial segregation to Chilean public education to daily life in Santiago (shout out to my host mother!). And now, back to the Silicon Valley bubble. Un besito para Chile, nos vemos al tiro!
